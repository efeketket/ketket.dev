# 💱 Trading with Player Shops

Once a player shop has been properly set up using the GUI, other players can start **buying items** from it.

---

## 🛍️ How to Trade

1. **Right-click** the shop block while holding the **payment item** (e.g. diamonds).
2. If your payment matches the shop's price, the trade will succeed.
3. You’ll receive the product in return, and the shop’s stock will decrease.
4. Your payment will be stored in the owner’s “earnings” slot.

---

## 💡 Example Trade

A shop is selling **Totem of Undying** for **4 Diamonds**.

- You hold 4 diamonds or more in hand.
- You right-click the shop.
- You instantly get a totem in return.
- The diamonds are stored in the shop’s earnings.
- Shop stock goes down by 1.

---

## 📦 Stock Behavior

- Trades will **only succeed if the shop has stock.**
- If the stock runs out, the trade will fail silently.
- Shop owners must restock by manually placing more items or using chests.

---

## 🧱 Stock Expansion

To increase how many items a shop can store:

- Drop a **chest** into the “Stock Slot” inside the GUI.
- This increases the max capacity.

---

## 🛡️ Safe Trading

- Only the shop owner can access or change the shop.
- Buyers can only interact through right-clicking with correct payment.
- No other interaction (breaking, stealing) is allowed.

---

## 🧼 Invalid Trades

Trades will **not complete** if:

- The item in hand doesn’t match the price
- You’re holding too little
- The shop has no product stock left
