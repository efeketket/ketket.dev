# ⚰️ Ketket's Graves – Secure Your Items

When players die, their items are safely stored in **Graves** at the location of death.  
This helps avoid losing items to lava, despawn timers, or other players.

There are **14 different types of graves**, each styled based on the **biome** or **dimension** where the player dies.
