## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Efe Ketenci** — a 21-year-old developer based in Istanbul, and a senior student in Mathematics and Computer Science at Eskişehir Osmangazi University.

I design and implement projects in **software development**, **mathematical modeling**, and **audiovisual applications**.
Managing the entire process from idea to launch on my own gives me great flexibility and vision, both technically and creatively.

## 🧠 What Motivates Me?

I approach most things with the mindset: “**Why not make it better?**” This perspective strongly motivates me in the projects I develop and contribute to.

Although my perfectionist nature sometimes causes me to get caught up in details, I believe it contributes positively to the quality of the final product.

For me, it’s not enough for code to simply work; the structure must be **meaningful, sustainable, and usable**.
Working in the gaming industry, where performance efficiency is critical, has firmly instilled this habit in me.
