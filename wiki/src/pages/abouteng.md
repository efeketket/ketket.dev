## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Efe Ketenci**, a 21-year-old developer based in Istanbul, Turkey.  
I'm currently a 3rd-year student at Eskişehir Osmangazi University, studying Mathematics and Computer Science.

I work on a wide range of projects — primarily focused on software development, mathematical modeling, and audiovisual systems.  
These days, I usually handle my projects **end-to-end**, from idea generation and coding to design and deployment. I believe this hands-on approach has helped me grow across multiple disciplines.

## 🧠 What Drives Me?

I approach most things in life with the mindset: *"Why not make it better?"*  
Many of the projects I've built were born out of that same motivation.

As a kid, I loved playing games — but eventually, I wanted to make them better. That led me to create mods.  
At university, I started developing tools to solve practical problems I noticed in student clubs and in our sports team.  
Sometimes, a small need turned into a long-term project.

I'll admit: my perfectionism can make me lose time in the details — but I believe it also improves the quality of what I produce.

For me, it's not enough for code to simply work. It should be **meaningful**, **sustainable**, and **usable**.  
I pay special attention to **user experience** and **system efficiency** in every project I build.

## 🌐 What is ketket.dev?

I originally started this site as a **wiki** to document and support my game mods based on user requests.  
Over time, I realized it could become something more personal.

Now, **ketket.dev** serves as a platform where I share my projects, document my learning process, and reflect on the things I build.
